<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Alarms Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Addressable Systems</li><li>Conventional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire alarm systems are primarily categorized into addressable and conventional systems. Addressable systems use advanced technology to provide unique identification for each device, allowing for precise location tracking and faster response during emergencies. They facilitate easier troubleshooting and maintenance. In contrast, conventional systems group detectors and devices into zones, signaling the general area of an alarm but lacking specific device identification. This makes addressable systems more suitable for large or complex facilities, while conventional systems are often chosen for smaller, simpler applications.</p></p>
