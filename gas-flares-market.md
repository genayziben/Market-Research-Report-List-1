<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Flares Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enclosed Flare</li><li>Open Flare</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas flares market consists of two primary types: enclosed flares and open flares. Enclosed flares are designed for efficient combustion, capturing emissions, and minimizing noise, often used in industries with strict environmental regulations. Open flares, in contrast, are simpler and less expensive, used primarily in remote locations or where regulations are less stringent, but can produce greater emissions and noise. Both types serve to safely dispose of excess gas while managing environmental impacts.</p></p>
