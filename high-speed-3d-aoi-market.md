<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Speed 3D AOI Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inline Type</li><li>Offline Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The High Speed 3D Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) market comprises two main types: inline and offline systems. Inline AOI systems are integrated directly into the manufacturing process, allowing real-time inspection of products as they move along the production line, thus enabling immediate feedback and adjustments. Offline AOI systems, on the other hand, operate independently from the production line, inspecting batch samples or completed products, which provides thorough evaluation but may slow down overall production flow. Both types enhance quality control in electronics manufacturing.</p></p>
